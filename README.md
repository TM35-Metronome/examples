# Metronome Examples

A repository that shows the extendability of the [Metronome](https://github.com/TM35-Metronome) project
by writing commands for it in any programming language. Wanna learn any of these languages, or understand some of the examples better? Catch me on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hejsil) where I stream the creation of the examples and other programming related things.

## Languages:
* [`x86_64 assembly (linux)`](x86_64/rand_starters.asm)
* [`haskell`](haskell/Main.hs)
